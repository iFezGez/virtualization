# Virtualization Repository

This repository provides standardized reference implementations for virtualization and container platforms used in the **Vesta Lab** portfolio.  Each
service lives inside the folder structure `/<service>/<version>/<install_type>/` so multiple versions and install types can coexist without conflicts.  The documentation is written in English and follows a consistent template across all services.
